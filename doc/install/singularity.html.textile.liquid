Arvados can be configured to use Singularity instead of Docker to execute containers on cloud nodes or a SLURM/LSF cluster.

Please note:
* *Singularity support is currently considered experimental.*
* Even when using the singularity runtime, users' container images are expected to be saved in Docker format using @arv keep docker@. Arvados converts the Docker image to Singularity format (@.sif@) at runtime as needed. Specifying a @.sif@ file as an image when submitting a container request is not yet supported.
* Singularity does not limit the amount of memory available in a container. Each container will have access to all memory on the host where it runs.
* Programs running in containers may behave differently due to differences between Singularity and Docker, _e.g._, the root (image) filesystem is read-only in a Singularity container.
* Arvados is currently tested with Singularity version 3.5.2.

To use singularity, first make sure Singularity is installed on your cloud worker image or SLURM/LSF compute nodes as applicable.

<notextile>
<pre><code>$ <span class="userinput">singularity version</span>
3.5.2
</code></pre>
</notextile>

Then update @Containers.RuntimeEngine@ in your cluster configuration:

<notextile>
<pre><code>      # Container runtime: "docker" (default) or "singularity" (experimental)
      RuntimeEngine: singularity
</code></pre>
</notextile>

Restart your dispatcher (@crunch-dispatch-slurm@ or @arvados-dispatch-cloud@) after updating your configuration file.
