This installation method is not fully implemented, which is why this page is not yet listed in the "table of installation options":{{site.baseurl}}/install/index.html or in the left nav.
{% include 'notebox_end' %}

This method sets up a new Arvados cluster using a single host/VM. It is the easiest way to get a new production cluster up and running.

A single-node installation supports all Arvados functionality at small scale. Substantial workloads will require additional nodes and configuration steps.

h2. Prerequisites

You will need:
* a server host running Debian 10 (buster) or Debian 11 (bullseye).
* a unique 5-character ID like @x9999@ for your cluster (first character should be @[a-w]@ for a long-lived / production cluster; all characters are @[a-z0-9]@).
* a DNS name like @x9999.example.com@ that resolves to your server host (or a load balancer / proxy that passes HTTP and HTTPS requests through to your server host).
* a Google account (use it in place of <code>example@gmail.com.example</code> in the instructions below).

h2. Initialize the cluster

<pre>
# echo > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/arvados.list "deb http://apt.arvados.org/buster buster main"
# apt-get update
# apt-get install arvados-server-easy
# arvados-server init -cluster-id x9999 -domain x9999.example.com -tls acme -admin-email example@gmail.com.example
</pre>

When the "init" command is finished, navigate to the link shown in the terminal (e.g., @https://x9999.example.com/token?api_token=zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz@). This will log you in to your admin account.

h2. Enable login

Follow the instructions to "set up Google login":{{site.baseurl}}/install/setup-login.html or another authentication option.

After updating your configuration file (@/etc/arvados/config.yml@), restart the server to make your changes take effect:

<pre>
# systemctl restart arvados-server
</pre>
