Most Arvados services publish a snapshot of HTTP requests currently being serviced at @/_inspect/requests@. This can be useful for troubleshooting slow requests and understanding high server load conditions.

To access snapshots, services must be configured with a "management token":management-token.html. When accessing this endpoint, prefix the management token with @"Bearer "@ and supply it in the @Authorization@ request header.

In an interactive setting, use the @jq@ tool to format the JSON response.

<pre>curl -sfH "Authorization: Bearer your_management_token_goes_here" "https://0.0.0.0:25107/_inspect/requests" | jq .
</pre>

h2. Report fields

Most fields are self explanatory.

The @Host@ field reports the virtual host specified in the incoming HTTP request.

The @RemoteAddr@ field reports the source of the incoming TCP connection, which is typically a local address associated with the Nginx proxy service.

The @Elapsed@ field reports the number of seconds since the incoming HTTP request headers were received.
