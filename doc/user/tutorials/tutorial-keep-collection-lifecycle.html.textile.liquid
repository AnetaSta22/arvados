Collections have a sophisticated data lifecycle, which is documented in the architecture guide at "Collection lifecycle":{{ site.baseurl }}/architecture/keep-data-lifecycle.html#collection_lifecycle.

Arvados supports trashing (deletion) of collections. For a period of time after a collection is trashed, it can be "untrashed". After that period, the collection is permanently deleted, though there may still be ways to recover the data, see "Recovering data":{{ site.baseurl }}/admin/keep-recovering-data.html in the admin guide for more details.
