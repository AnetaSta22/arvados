Storage classes (alternately known as "storage tiers") allow you to control which volumes should be used to store particular collection data blocks.  This can be used to implement data storage policies such as moving data to archival storage.

Names of storage classes are internal to the cluster and decided by the administrator.  Aside from "default", Arvados currently does not define any standard storage class names.

h3. arv-put

You may specify one or more desired storage classes for a collection uploaded using @arv-put@:

<pre>
$ arv-put --storage-classes=hot,archival myfile.txt
</pre>

h3. arv-mount

You can ask @arv-mount@ to use specific storage classes when creating new collections:

<pre>
$ arv-mount --storage-classes=transient --mount-tmp=scratch keep
</pre>

h3. arvados-cwl-runner

You may also specify the desired storage class for the final output collection produced by @arvados-cwl-runner@:

<pre>
$ arvados-cwl-runner --storage-classes=hot myworkflow.cwl myinput.yml
</pre>

(Note: intermediate collections produced by a workflow run will use the cluster's default storage class(es).)

h3. arv command line

You may set the storage class on an existing collection by setting the "storage_classes_desired" field of a Collection.  For example, at the command line:

<pre>
$ arv collection update --uuid zzzzz-4zz18-dhhm0ay8k8cqkvg --collection '{"storage_classes_desired": ["archival"]}'
</pre>

By setting "storage_classes_desired" to "archival", the blocks that make up the collection will be preferentially moved to keepstore volumes which are configured with the "archival" storage class.

h3. Storage class notes

Collection blocks will be in the cluster's configured default storage class(es) if not otherwise specified.

Any user with write access to a collection may set any storage class on that collection.
