Arvados is in the process of migrating from the classic web application, referred to as "Workbench 1", to a completely new web application, referred to as "Workbench 2".

Workbench 2 is the new Workbench web application that will, over time, replace Workbench 1. Workbench 2 is being built based on user feedback, and it is approaching feature parity with Workbench 1.  Workbench 2 has a modern look and feel and offers several advanced features and performance enhancements.  Arvados clusters typically have both Workbench applications installed and have a dropdown menu option in the user menu to switch between versions.

Workbench 2 is stable and recommended for general use, but still lacks some features available in the classic Workbench 1 application.  When necessary, you can easily switch back:
